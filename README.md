# AdventOfCode2022
Here I will be sharing my AOC code for 2022 :)

This year, I took a challenge upon myself to solve the problems in this year's AOC in both 
Java (which I am more comfortable with) and Python to strengthen my algorithmic thinking in that language.

All code should be directly runnable in both Python and Java with just their main functions.
